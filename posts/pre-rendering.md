Contemporary art, like most creative industries, is sadly governed by money. When something like a subculture is absorbed by the commercial side of art and somehow tamed or cut up into easily digested pieces, made palatable for a particular audience, there is a something disheartening about it. Should **movements** like rave culture be kept solely for those who dared to experience them and a million miles away from **contemporary art**, or is documenting them in this way as important as documenting any part of history? Whatever the answer may be, rave culture’s impact as one of the most important and original subcultures of our time is undeniable and its influence doesn’t show any signs of diminishing. “It was a futuristic movement – a movement of  **futuristic music**, of doing new things, new drugs – a new kind of love,” Van Linge tells me. “I’m not sure whether the same group of people could go through that again – maybe if you talk about different cultures – maybe from a typical Eurocentric perspective, but maybe not. The world is a lot bigger.”
