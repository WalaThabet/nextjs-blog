As I grew as a  **photographer**, I picked up a ton of lessons I found valuable as I journey my way to become a Software Engineer. Here’s some of the key things I’ve learnt along the way.

- You can never please everybody, but that’s okay.

Photography is an art. Every photographer is different, and there’s a style of photography suited for every couple. I had to deal with **rejections** a lot, from couples who didn’t like my craft. For the longest time, a little voice in my head attributed that ‘failure’ to a shortcoming on my part — maybe I wasn’t good enough, maybe the work I doing was mediocre. Either way, I saw it as a failure on my part, and I beat myself up pretty hard for it. It really affected the quality of my work a lot, as I felt drained trying to be a photographer I’m not.

Boy, did that really change things. In my quest to be a Software Engineer, the hunt for internships was a road faced with rejections. I tried my best to take them **positively**, to see every rejection as a reminder to work harder, to seize every opportunity I’ve received as an **opportunity** to prove myself. To see rejections as a cup half full.

- Learn from others

There’s always a better photographer out there, and there’s always somebody better than me. While it’s no reason to beat myself up, it certainly is a **great yardstick** for me to work towards.

The same can be said for my engineering journey as well. In my journey, I have come across many incredible people who have vast amounts of experience and wisdom, and I’ve made it a note to learn as I can from their experience, and **grow** as an engineer in the process. Even the wisest people are always learning, always humble, and always curious for knowledge, and I should do the same.

- Treat people well

Couples are extremely nervous leading up to the big day, and as much as I could, I took it upon myself to make sure they didn’t have to worry (about me at least). One of the strategies I employed was to befriend them. Silly as that sounds, I try my best to see my couples as my friends, not my clients, for this very cliched reason:
  **Life is always better with friends.** 

When I befriend my couples, it becomes a lot more comfortable, which translates into more **raw emotions** in the images, and couples feel less awkward with me around as they share their intimate sessions on their wedding day.

In my experiences as an intern, I started to realise the importance of treating people well. Engineers often work in **teams**, and a team is only as strong as its weakest link. Teams feed off the strengths of each other, and any positive momentum can carry a team far. For that reason, the importance of treating teammates well and **fostering close bonds** cannot be stressed enough. It takes the commitment of everyone in the team to build a strong team culture, but it also takes one ill-mannered or uncooperative team member to ruin everything. This is a reminder for me to remember to treat teammates and co-workers well, and **build strong connections** in the process.
